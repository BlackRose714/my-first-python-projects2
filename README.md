üí° What I've Learned So Far

Variable declaration

Getting input from users

Conditional logic (if, else)

Type conversion (int, str, etc.)

Basic mathematical operations

Loops (while, for)

Use of break and continue

Working with strings at a basic level

Writing clean and structured code


‚ú® Ongoing Progress

From now on, I‚Äôll be writing and uploading my code in English on GitHub. This will help me improve both my programming and my technical English skills.
This week, I‚Äôm planning to create small projects to reinforce my understanding of loops, conditionals, and strings.

Next steps:

Functions

Geometric shape calculations

Global and local variables

Dictionary data structures


I‚Äôll keep adding new projects step by step and continue growing my skills. üöÄ
Feel free to follow along and grow with me!

Factorial Calculator

This Python program asks the user to input a non-negative integer and calculates its factorial, then prints the result.

‚ùì What is a Factorial?

The factorial of a positive integer is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

Examples:

5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 120

0! = 1 (by definition)

üß† Used Python Features

Structure	Description

while True:	Starts an infinite loop until valid input is given.
input()	Takes input from the user.
int()	Converts the input into an integer.
if / else	Handles error checking for negative values.
for i in range(1, sayi+1):	Multiplies numbers from 1 to the input number.



User Login and Password Update System

üíª Project Description

This is a simple Python project that simulates a basic login system using a username and password. If the user provides correct credentials, access is granted. If the password is incorrect, the user is offered the option to update it.

üîç Features and Structures Used

Variable Declaration: gamer_name, gamer_password

User Input: input()

Conditional Logic: if, elif, else

Loop: while True

String Comparison

String Method: lower()


üß† Key Learnings

Taking and handling user input

Making decisions using conditions

Controlling user attempts with an infinite loop

Using if-elif-else logic

String comparisons

Making input case-insensitive with lower() method
break	Exits the loop once a valid result is printed.
