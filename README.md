# 🐍 My First Python Projects

## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm a self-taught developer focused on building clean, functional Python applications.  
I enjoy transforming every concept I learn into practical mini-projects and strengthening my logic through hands-on coding.

💻 I care about:
- Writing clean, readable, and well-structured code  
- Creating beginner-friendly, useful programs  
- Continuously improving by experimenting with real-world problems  

If you're looking for thoughtfully written, beginner-level Python code, feel free to explore my work below.

## 🧠 My Learning Journal: Python Beginner Projects

### 📚 What I’ve Learned So Far

- ✅ Variable declaration  
- 🔢 Type conversions (int, str)  
- 📥 Taking user input with input()  
- 🔄 Conditional logic (if, elif, else)  
- ➗ Basic math operations  
- 🧼 Writing clean and structured code  
- 🔁 Loops (while, for)  
- ⏹ break and continue statements  
- 🧮 Functions and parameters  
- 📐 Geometric shape classification  
- 🪣 Working with lists  
- 🛠 Input validation with try/except

---

### 🚧 Ongoing Progress

I’m currently building small projects using the concepts above and working toward:

- 🔎 Using dictionaries (dict)  
- 💾 File operations (read/write)  
- 🧠 More advanced function usage  
- 🏗 Developing larger beginner projects  
- 📁 Learning Git and GitHub version control

### 📌 Project 1: Factorial Calculator

*Description:*  
A Python program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user.

*🧠 Concepts Used:*

| Feature        | Description                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| while True   | Repeats until valid input is given                |
| input()      | Takes input from the user                         |
| int()        | Converts input to integer                         |
| if / else    | Handles negative values and flow control          |
| for loop     | Multiplies numbers from 1 to input                |

*ℹ What is a Factorial?*

- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120  
- 0! = 1 (by definition)

### 📌 Project 2: User Login & Password Update System

*Description:*  
A simple username/password login simulation. Grants access if credentials match, or offers password update if incorrect.

*🧠 Concepts Used:*

- Variable declaration: gamer_name, gamer_password  
- User input: input()  
- Conditional logic: if, elif, else  
- Infinite loop with while True  
- String comparison and lower() for case-insensitive matching  
- break to exit loop after successful login/update

### 📌 Project 3: Geometric Shape Identifier

*Description:*  
Classifies triangles and quadrilaterals based on side lengths entered by the user.

*🧠 Concepts Used:*

- User input and validation  
- Lists and append()  
- Error handling with try/except  
- Conditional logic: if, elif, else  
- Function usage  
- Shape validation logic (e.g. triangle sum rule)

*📌 How It Works:*

1. User enters number of sides (3 or 4)  
2. Enters corresponding side lengths  
3. Program identifies:
   - Triangle: Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, or Invalid  
   - Quadrilateral: Square, Rectangle, or General  
4. Invalid inputs trigger appropriate warnings and restart

*✅ Example Output:*

Enter the number of sides (3 / 4): 3
Enter side 1: 4
Enter side 2: 4
Enter side 3: 4
Result: Equilateral Triangle
