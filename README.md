💡 What I've Learned So Far

Variable declaration

Getting input from users

Conditional logic (if, else)

Type conversion (int, str, etc.)

Basic mathematical operations

Loops (while, for)

Use of break and continue

Working with strings at a basic level

Writing clean and structured code


✨ Ongoing Progress


🧠 Geometric Shape Identifier

A basic Python program to classify triangles and quadrilaterals based on user input.


---

💡 What This Project Covers

Receiving user input

Using try-except blocks for error handling

Working with lists

Using if, elif, else conditional statements

Using functions

Validating data length and shape rules



---

📌 How It Works

1. The program asks the user how many sides the shape has (3 or 4).


2. It collects the required side lengths.


3. If the user enters a valid number of values, the program classifies the shape:

Triangles (3 sides):

Equilateral

Isosceles

Scalene

Or it’s not a valid triangle if the sum rule fails.


Quadrilaterals (4 sides):

Square

Rectangle

General quadrilateral




4. If invalid input is entered (like letters or missing sides), it shows appropriate warnings and restarts.

🔧 Functions Used

Function/Structure	Purpose

input()	Takes user input
int()	Converts input to integer
try/except	Catches non-integer input
len()	Checks the number of elements
print()	Displays results
list.append()	Adds values to a list



---

✅ Example Run

Enter the number of sides (3 / 4): 3
Enter side 1: 4
Enter side 2: 4
Enter side 3: 4
Equilateral triangle
From now on, I’ll be writing and uploading my code in English on GitHub. This will help me improve both my programming and my technical English skills.
This week, I’m planning to create small projects to reinforce my understanding of loops, conditionals, and strings.

Next steps:

Functions

Geometric shape calculations

Global and local variables

Dictionary data structures


I’ll keep adding new projects step by step and continue growing my skills. 🚀
Feel free to follow along and grow with me!

Factorial Calculator

This Python program asks the user to input a non-negative integer and calculates its factorial, then prints the result.

❓ What is a Factorial?

The factorial of a positive integer is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

Examples:

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

0! = 1 (by definition)

🧠 Used Python Features

Structure	Description

while True:	Starts an infinite loop until valid input is given.
input()	Takes input from the user.
int()	Converts the input into an integer.
if / else	Handles error checking for negative values.
for i in range(1, sayi+1):	Multiplies numbers from 1 to the input number.



User Login and Password Update System

💻 Project Description

This is a simple Python project that simulates a basic login system using a username and password. If the user provides correct credentials, access is granted. If the password is incorrect, the user is offered the option to update it.

🔍 Features and Structures Used

Variable Declaration: gamer_name, gamer_password

User Input: input()

Conditional Logic: if, elif, else

Loop: while True

String Comparison

String Method: lower()


🧠 Key Learnings

Taking and handling user input

Making decisions using conditions

Controlling user attempts with an infinite loop

Using if-elif-else logic

String comparisons

Making input case-insensitive with lower() method
break	Exits the loop once a valid result is printed.
