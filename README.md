----About Me-----

Hello, I'm a developer building Python-based applications with a focus on clear structure, logic, and functionality.
I work consistently to strengthen my skills by turning what I learn into real, usable projects.

My GitHub includes hands-on examples such as user login systems, geometric shape analysis, and basic mathematical tools.
My goal is to contribute to freelance projects and become a reliable collaborator in the field of software development.

I prioritize clean code, user-friendly design, and well-structured functions.
I’m also continuously expanding my knowledge in programming principles and new technologies.

If you’re looking for simple, clear, and thoughtfully written code, feel free to check out my work here.

🧠 My Learning Journal: Python Beginner Projects

💡 What I’ve Learned So Far

📦 Variable declaration

🔢 Type conversions (int, str)

📥 Taking input from the user

🔄 Conditional logic structures (if, else, elif)

➗ Basic mathematical operations

🧼 Writing clean and structured code

🔁 Loops (while, for)

⏹ Break and Continue statements

🧮 Functions and function parameters

📐 Geometric shape recognition and calculation

🪣 Lists and processing data with lists

✨ Ongoing Progress

I’m currently trying to apply what I’ve learned by building small projects.
My upcoming goals include:

🔎 Using dictionaries (dict) to store data

💾 File operations (saving and reading data)

🧠 More advanced function usage

🎯 Reinforcing my knowledge through larger projects

📁 Learning version control with Git and GitHub

🚀 Why Follow Me?

I’m a curious and passionate self-learner who’s building a solid foundation in Python — one small project at a time.
If you're interested in watching someone's real-time growth from beginner to developer, you're in the right place.
Let’s learn and grow together! 🌱

*****Factorial Calculator*****

This Python program asks the user to input a non-negative integer and calculates its factorial, then prints the result.

❓ What is a Factorial?

The factorial of a positive integer is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

Examples:

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

0! = 1 (by definition)

🧠 Used Python Features

Structure	Description

while True:	Starts an infinite loop until valid input is given.
input()	Takes input from the user.
int()	Converts the input into an integer.
if / else	Handles error checking for negative values.
for i in range(1, sayi+1):	Multiplies numbers from 1 to the input number.



******User Login and Password Update System*****

💻 Project Description

This is a simple Python project that simulates a basic login system using a username and password. If the user provides correct credentials, access is granted. If the password is incorrect, the user is offered the option to update it.

🔍 Features and Structures Used

Variable Declaration: gamer_name, gamer_password

User Input: input()

Conditional Logic: if, elif, else

Loop: while True

String Comparison

String Method: lower()


🧠 Key Learnings

Taking and handling user input

Making decisions using conditions

Controlling user attempts with an infinite loop

Using if-elif-else logic

String comparisons

Making input case-insensitive with lower() method
break	Exits the loop once a valid result is printed.



*****🧠 Geometric Shape Identifier*****

A basic Python program to classify triangles and quadrilaterals based on user input.


---

💡 What This Project Covers

Receiving user input

Using try-except blocks for error handling

Working with lists

Using if, elif, else conditional statements

Using functions

Validating data length and shape rules



---

📌 How It Works

1. The program asks the user how many sides the shape has (3 or 4).


2. It collects the required side lengths.


3. If the user enters a valid number of values, the program classifies the shape:

Triangles (3 sides):

Equilateral

Isosceles

Scalene

Or it’s not a valid triangle if the sum rule fails.


Quadrilaterals (4 sides):

Square

Rectangle

General quadrilateral




4. If invalid input is entered (like letters or missing sides), it shows appropriate warnings and restarts.




---

🔧 Functions Used

Function/Structure	Purpose

input()	Takes user input
int()	Converts input to integer
try/except	Catches non-integer input
len()	Checks the number of elements
print()	Displays results
list.append()	Adds values to a list



---

✅ Example Run

Enter the number of sides (3 / 4): 3
Enter side 1: 4
Enter side 2: 4
Enter side 3: 4
Equilateral triangle
